Insecure Passwords and Recommendations for Improvement
This report highlights a critical security issue: a large number of passwords were cracked due to weak hashing and password policies.

Weak Hashing Algorithm:

The analysis identified the hashing algorithm as MD5, which is outdated and vulnerable to brute-force attacks. Modern algorithms like bcrypt and Argon2id offer significantly better protection.

Cracked Passwords Reveal Weak Practices:

The high number of cracked passwords suggests users employed weak password creation methods. Short passwords with limited character types (letters only) are easy to crack. Additionally, common patterns like keyboard sequences and repetitive characters were prevalent, making them prime targets for hackers.

Recommendations for Stronger Passwords:

Minimum Length: Enforce a minimum password length of 12-14 characters. This significantly increases the number of possible combinations, making brute-forcing much harder.
Character Diversity: Require passwords to include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. This creates a larger "key space" and strengthens password security.
Disallowed Passwords: Ban the use of common dictionary words, keyboard patterns, and personal information in passwords. Hackers often attempt these guesses first.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Implement MFA as an additional security layer. MFA requires a second verification factor besides the password, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
Examples of Weak Passwords:

The report includes anonymized examples of usernames and the corresponding cracked passwords (all weak):

123456, 123456789 (simple number sequences)
qwerty, qazxsw (common keyboard patterns)
password, password1 (dictionary words)
111111 (repetitive characters)
abc123 (predictable combination)
